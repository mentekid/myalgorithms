### Huffman Encoding / Decoding
Small Python script that encodes and decodes text using Huffman encoding.

### Encoding
Reads a single file, and strips the text from any characters other than letters, numbers, space, dot and comma. Outputs the 'encoded' text into a different file. ***The output is not really compressed, since ASCII characters are actually used for representation.***

### Decoding
Given a codebook and an 'encoded' file, outputs a single line of text. A codebook is included to demonstrate the format.
